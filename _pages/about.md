<p> Welcome to my website. I am Huzama, a PhD candidate at the <a href='https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/'>Kim Jaechul Graduate School of AI</a> at <a href='https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/'> Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology</a>. Currently, I am working in the <a href="https://xfact.net/"> xfact</a> under the guidance of <a href='https://jamesthorne.com/'> James Thorne</a>. My research focuses on aligning and customising Large Language Models to elicit the best response, while ensuring that they remain safe, trusted and harmless. Although it would be interesting to see AI perform tasks that have the potential to cause damage.
